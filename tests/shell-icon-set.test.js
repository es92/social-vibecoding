// The shell's glyphs come from ONE module, and their path data never moves.
//
// #1120 slice 4 pulled 36 inline `<svg>` blocks out of frontend/src/features/**
// and into frontend/@/components/ui/icons.tsx. The conversion is worth almost
// nothing on its own — it is worth something only if the two things that make
// an icon swap dangerous stay pinned:
//
//   1. The path data is the shell's own. shadcn's examples import glyphs from
//      `lucide-react`, and lucide has a same-named counterpart for nearly
//      every icon below drawn on a different grid. Adding that package would
//      restyle thirty-odd buttons in one commit while every diff line still
//      read like a rename.
//   2. Nothing drifts back. One inline `<svg>` re-added beside the module is
//      how a set ends up with two spellings of the same glyph, which is the
//      state this slice found the tree in (five copies of the close X, four of
//      the back chevron).
//
// The strongest strand here is the third test: every `d` in the PRERENDERED
// document has to be a string this module exports. That is what makes "the
// path data is unchanged" checkable rather than asserted — the shipped
// markup is compared against the source of truth, not against a fixture of
// itself.
