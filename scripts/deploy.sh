# Deploy the Homeroom platform on the VPS.
#
# This is THE deploy: the single copy of the logic that used to live
# inline in .github/workflows/deploy.yml's ssh step. It has exactly two
# callers, and both run it on the VPS as the `deploy` user from
# /opt/usernode:
#
#   1. The host deployer (scripts/usernode-deployer.sh, a systemd
#      service on the VPS) — the PRIMARY path. It polls github.com for
#      a new main head, rsyncs the tree into place, and invokes this
#      script. No GitHub Actions runner is involved, so a GHA outage
#      (2026-08-06) cannot stall production deploys.
#   2. The Deploy workflow (.github/workflows/deploy.yml) — the
#      FALLBACK path, and the only path that can rotate secrets: it
#      composes a fresh .env from GitHub secrets and forwards it as
#      BASE_ENV_B64.
#
# Inputs (environment variables):
#
#   DEPLOY_SHA           (required) the sha being deployed; written to
#                        .env as GIT_SHA.
#   BASE_ENV_B64         (optional) base64 of a complete .env. When set,
#                        .env is REWRITTEN from it (workflow path, which
#                        resolves GitHub secrets). When empty, the
#                        existing .env is kept and only GIT_SHA is
#                        patched (host-deployer path — the .env from the
#                        last secret-bearing deploy stays authoritative).
#   GH_PLATFORM_ENV_B64  (optional) base64 of GitHub-sourced platform
#                        variable lines, appended after the base .env.
#   CNPG_REPLICATION_PASSWORD_B64
#                        (optional) base64 of the database-only replication
#                        password. The workflow sends it; the host deployer
#                        reuses the protected runtime file from that run.
#   NODE_FILES_CHANGED   'true' when this deploy touches the sidecar's
#                        compose definition or archive scripts.
#   CADDY_FILES_CHANGED  'true' when caddy.Dockerfile changed.
#   FORCE_ARCHIVE_REFRESH 'true' to force the archive refresh path.
#   SKIP_IF_CURRENT      '1' to exit 0 without rebuilding when
#                        DEPLOY_SHA is already deployed and healthy.
#                        Set by the workflow's push trigger and the host
#                        deployer so the two paths never double-deploy
#                        the same commit; workflow_dispatch leaves it
#                        unset so a manual re-run always redeploys.
#
# Single-flight: both callers can fire for the same push, so the whole
# script runs under an exclusive flock. The loser of the race waits,
# then sees GIT_SHA already at its target and (with SKIP_IF_CURRENT)
# exits without a second rebuild.
