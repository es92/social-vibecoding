# Usernode Social Vibecoding

> where the users are the developers are the users are the developers...

A social platform where every signed-in user can propose changes to
any app — and to the platform itself — through a chat-driven
Mayor / Claude Code pipeline that produces real PRs.

## Design docs

- **[SPEC.md](./SPEC.md)** — overall architecture, auth model, app
  layout, URL conventions.
- **[EXTRACT-PLAN.md](./EXTRACT-PLAN.md)** — phased plan for moving
  this repo from a monorepo subdirectory to a standalone deploy.
- **[BUILD-METHODS.md](./BUILD-METHODS.md)** — inventory of the eight
  ways to build (in-platform sessions through local agents), the
  provider-policy constraints that shape them, and the direction for
  the #1281 discovery/selection rework.
- **[SELF-HOSTING.md](./SELF-HOSTING.md)** — operational reference
  for the shipped self-app: DB rename runbook, rollback procedure,
  flag-flip recipes, why each phase exists. The phase numbers here
  are cited from comments throughout the codebase.
- **[src/prompts/app-conventions.md](./src/prompts/app-conventions.md)**
  — authoritative platform conventions injected into Mayor and
  Claude Code prompts. Also served live at `/claude.md` on every
  running instance (see `server.js`).

## Deployment paths

This code ships in two shapes:

1. **Standalone** (this repo's `docker-compose.yml` + host deployer /
   GitHub Actions fallback) — a self-contained stack (Caddy, the
   platform itself as blue/green colors, Postgres, the sidecar chain
   node, MinIO, and acme-dns) that runs on a dedicated VPS. This is the
   intended long-term home and the target of Phase 3 of
   `EXTRACT-PLAN.md`.
2. **Legacy, in the `evanshapi.ro` monorepo** — consumed as a git
   submodule by the `evanshapi.ro` orchestrator, which generates a
   combined compose file covering all its projects and a shared Caddy.
   Keeps running for backwards compatibility while the standalone
   deploy matures.

Both paths run the same image. The `USERNODE_DOMAIN` env var is what
keeps them straight — scaffolded-app URLs, Caddy vhosts, and the
`/claude.md` link in child-app CLAUDE files are all driven from it.

## Standalone deployment

### One-time server setup

On a fresh Ubuntu VPS (Hetzner, DigitalOcean, whatever), run
`scripts/server-bootstrap.sh` as root:

```bash
# Generate a dedicated SSH keypair for GitHub Actions first:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f usernode-deploy -C 'actions@usernode' -N ''

# Then on the VPS, as root:
sudo DEPLOY_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY="$(cat usernode-deploy.pub)" bash server-bootstrap.sh
```

This installs Docker, creates a `deploy` user, opens ports 22/80/443,
and authorizes the SSH key.

### DNS

Point two A records at the VPS IP:

- `<USERNODE_DOMAIN>` — the apex
- `*.<USERNODE_DOMAIN>` — wildcard, for per-app subdomains
  (`myapp.<USERNODE_DOMAIN>` + staging URLs)

Caddy will auto-issue Let's Encrypt certs on first request for each
hostname — no cert provisioning needed from you.

### GitHub secrets & variables

In the repo's Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:

**Secrets:**
- `DEPLOY_HOST` — VPS IP or hostname
- `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY` — the *private* half of the keypair above
- `USERNODE_ADMIN_USERNAME`, `USERNODE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- `USERNODE_SESSION_SECRET`
- `USERNODE_JWT_SECRET` — despite the name this is now only the
  data-at-rest encryption key (deployed as `DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY`).
  **Never rotate it:** it's the AES KDF input for every stored BYOK
  key and app secret.
- `USERNODE_WORKER_JWT_SECRET`, `USERNODE_EDGE_JWT_SECRET`
  (`openssl rand -hex 32` each — safe to rotate)
- `USERNODE_IFRAME_JWT_PRIVATE_KEY`, `USERNODE_IFRAME_JWT_PUBLIC_KEY`
  — RSA-2048 pair for app identity tokens, single line with literal
  `\n` (see `.env.example` for the `openssl`/`awk` recipe)
- `USERNODE_DB_PASSWORD`
- `USERNODE_GITHUB_APP_ID`, `USERNODE_GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY`
  (single line with literal `\n`), `USERNODE_GITHUB_BOT_TOKEN`
- `USERNODE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (optional — BYOK covers the rest)

**Variables:**
- `USERNODE_DOMAIN` — the domain DNS now points at

### First deploy

Actions tab → **Deploy** → Run workflow. The workflow rsyncs code to
`/opt/usernode` on the VPS, writes `.env` from the secrets above, brings
up the infra services (Caddy, Postgres, sidecar node, MinIO, acme-dns),
then runs the blue-green rollout (`scripts/platform-rollout.sh`) to
start the platform. Caddy auto-issues TLS on the first HTTPS request.

Steady-state deploys after that are handled by the host-side deployer
(`scripts/usernode-deployer.sh`, a systemd service on the VPS — see
SELF-HOSTING.md); the workflow stays as the secret-rotation and manual
fallback path.

### Zero-downtime deploys (blue-green)

The platform runs as two interchangeable colors, `usernode-blue` and
`usernode-green` (one YAML anchor in `docker-compose.yml`; they differ
only in name). Exactly one color serves the apex + per-app access-gate
vhosts at a time. A deploy builds the new image, starts the *idle*
color, waits for it to pass `/health`, flips Caddy's active-color
import file (`caddy/active/platform-upstream.caddy` — host-managed
state, excluded from deploy rsyncs) to it via a graceful `caddy
reload`, then drains and stops the old color — see
`scripts/platform-rollout.sh`.

HTTP handling is stateless against the shared Postgres, so both colors
can serve during the brief cutover overlap. The singleton background
work (worker adoption, headless resume, recovery, sweepers, the
main-drift poller) is gated behind a Postgres advisory lock
(`src/services/leadership.js`): the old color stays leader until it
stops and releases the lock, then the new color promotes itself. That
ordering is why traffic flips *before* the old color stops.
`PLATFORM_LEADER_LOCK` toggles the gate — set in compose for prod;
unset in local dev/tests, so a single instance is leader immediately
and behaves exactly as before.

The very first blue-green deploy (cutting over from the old single
`usernode` container) has a brief apex blip while the first color
boots (Caddy's 30s hold-and-retry absorbs most of it); every deploy
after that is zero-downtime.

### Recovery (rollback to a known-good SHA)

If a deploy lands a broken commit and the platform UI is down or
misbehaving, the kill-switch is `/opt/usernode-tools/rollback.sh`
on the VPS. It deliberately lives outside `/opt/usernode/` so a
broken deploy can't clobber it, and it re-clones the repo from
GitHub at the target SHA — so it works even when local state is
corrupted.

Find a known-good SHA at
`https://github.com/Usernode-Labs/social-vibecoding/commits/main`,
then SSH in and run:

```bash
ssh deploy@<DEPLOY_HOST>
# Optional sanity checks first:
grep ^GIT_SHA= /opt/usernode/.env       # what's running now
docker logs usernode-blue --tail 50     # what's broken (or -green; the
                                        # live color is whichever is up)

/opt/usernode-tools/rollback.sh <sha>
```

The script clones the target SHA into `/tmp`, rsyncs over
`/opt/usernode/` (preserving `.env`, `runtime/`, `data/`), updates
`GIT_SHA` in `.env`, and brings the harness back up. It detects the
shape of the rolled-back tree: a blue-green tree gets infra up + a
deterministic single-color recovery (green stopped, Caddy pointed at
blue, blue rebuilt and started — no zero-downtime dance; the harness is
presumed broken); a pre-blue-green tree gets the old
`docker compose up -d --build`. Named volumes (Postgres data, Caddy
state, sidecar archive) persist across rollback.

The script is auto-deployed by the Deploy workflow — every deploy
copies the latest version of `scripts/rollback.sh` into
`/opt/usernode-tools/`. So the script itself stays current with
the repo, but the directory it lives in survives `rsync --delete`.

**Rehearse it once before you need it.** Push a no-op commit (a
README typo fix is fine), wait for the deploy to finish, then run
`rollback.sh <prev_sha>` — confirm the harness comes back on the
previous SHA, the version pill in the UI shows it, and child apps
are unaffected. Schema migrations are forward-only, so don't
rehearse across a migration boundary.

### Migrating the platform DB to its `app_`-prefixed name (Phase 2d)

The platform's data lives in `app_usernode_2d5619` (per the
`app_<slug>` convention every child app follows). The Deploy
workflow handles the one-time rename automatically — the first
push that lands the `DATABASE_URL` change in `docker-compose.yml`
triggers an idempotent migration block in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
that:

1. Skips if `app_usernode_2d5619` already exists and is healthy
   (sanity-checks `users` is non-empty).
2. Otherwise stops the harness, `pg_dump`s `usernode`, creates
   `app_usernode_2d5619`, restores the dump, and verifies row
   counts match. Any failure drops the partial target DB and aborts.
3. Brings everything back up pointed at the new DB.

Maintenance window is ~2–5 min of platform downtime, exactly the
duration of the dump-and-restore. Child apps and the sidecar stay
up — `docker compose stop usernode` only stops the harness
service. Watch the deploy run logs; the migration block is clearly
labeled (`==> One-time migration: usernode -> app_usernode_2d5619`).

**Post-cutover:** the original `usernode` database stays in place
as a rollback target *and* as the bookkeeping DB `db-manager.js`
connects to when issuing `CREATE DATABASE` for new child apps —
do not drop it. (Postgres requires connecting to *some* database
to spawn another one; `usernode` is that meta-DB.) Rolling back
during the confidence window means flipping
`docker-compose.yml`'s `DATABASE_URL` back to `…/usernode` and
redeploying.

#### Manual fallback (only if the auto-migration is unable to run)

If you need to run the migration by hand (e.g. the auto-migration
hit a corner case and you want to do the steps yourself, or the
deploy workflow itself is down), here's the equivalent runbook:

```bash
ssh deploy@<DEPLOY_HOST>
cd /opt/usernode

# Pre-flight: note current counts.
docker exec usernode-db psql -U usernode -d usernode -c \
  "SELECT count(*) AS users FROM users; \
   SELECT count(*) AS apps  FROM apps;  \
   SELECT count(*) AS chat_messages FROM chat_messages;"

# Stop the harness; postgres/sidecar/caddy stay up.
docker compose stop usernode

# Dump → create → restore.
TS=$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)
docker exec -i usernode-db pg_dump -U usernode usernode \
  > /tmp/usernode-pre-rename-$TS.sql
docker exec -u postgres usernode-db createdb \
  -U usernode -O usernode app_usernode_2d5619
docker exec -i usernode-db psql -U usernode -d app_usernode_2d5619 \
  -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 < /tmp/usernode-pre-rename-$TS.sql

# Verify counts match exactly.
docker exec usernode-db psql -U usernode -d app_usernode_2d5619 -c \
  "SELECT count(*) AS users FROM users; \
   SELECT count(*) AS apps  FROM apps;  \
   SELECT count(*) AS chat_messages FROM chat_messages;"

# Bring everything back up against the new DB.
docker compose up -d --build
```

If the restore fails partway through, drop the partial DB and
retry: `docker exec -u postgres usernode-db dropdb -U usernode app_usernode_2d5619`.

## Running locally

Fill in `.env.example` → `.env`, set `USERNODE_LOCAL_DEV=1` and
`CLI_CANONICAL_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000` in your local `.env` (so
app/staging URLs and CLI authorization stay on the explicit local deployment
since Caddy can't issue real certs against `localhost`).

The local stack is two pieces because Docker Desktop on Mac can't run
the `usernode-node` sidecar (its WebRTC P2P doesn't survive the VM's
network stack), so the node runs natively on the host and the platform
container talks to it via `host.docker.internal:3001`.

Prereq: `make node-full` fetches a fresh archive snapshot via SSH from
`testnet-seed1` so the node boots in full-ledger mode (without it,
runtime `tracked_owner/add` calls trip the wallet-seed shortcut into
partial-overlay mode and the platform's `/__node-status` panel shows
the "Partial ledger mode" warning — see
`PARTIAL_LEDGER_RECENT_TX_SOURCE_BUG`). Add a `~/.ssh/config` entry for
`testnet-seed1` with the right `IdentityFile` (the same one used by
`usernode-dapp-starter`'s `make node-full`).

Two terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — native node on :3001 (one-time:
#   cd ../usernode && cargo build --release -p usernode-cli)
make node-full              # fetch fresh archive, then boot in full mode
# make node-full-no-fetch   # offline iteration: reuse ~/.usernode/archive

# Terminal 2 — platform + Postgres
make up           # docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
make logs         # tail
make down         # stop
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000`.

### Codex and Claude Code CLI authentication and MCP

Ask Codex or Claude Code for the platform operation directly, for example:

```text
Pull the open issues for app demo.
Pull the open issues for app demo from local.
Create and promote a proposal for app demo.
```

Repository guidance makes either agent use production by default. It selects the
immutable built-in `local` profile only when the prompt explicitly says local.
For local requests it checks health and runs `make up` when necessary. It
configures its project-local MCP server if missing and can finish the current
request through the generic CLI API client while a new MCP configuration waits
for the next client reload. Codex writes its ignored project configuration;
Claude Code uses its private `local` MCP scope through the installed `claude`
CLI. You do not need to run either setup command yourself.

The agent also handles authentication. If the selected profile has no usable
credential, it starts device login and waits. The only expected manual step is
in the browser: the one-click link opens the request details, you compare the
displayed code and select **Authorize**. There is no code to copy or type.
The agent then retries the original API operation; you do not need to type setup
or login commands.

The MCP exposes generic read and mutation tools for allowed user-facing JSON
API paths, so endpoints are not hardcoded into individual tools. Existing
platform app visibility, ownership, role, lock, and quota checks remain
authoritative. Operations such as opening a PR go through the app/session
platform APIs, never directly to GitHub.

Credentials are bound to the selected server profile and are stored
outside the checkout. The ignored `.codex/config.toml` contains absolute
launcher paths and a reviewed tool allowlist, but no credential or server
origin. Claude Code stores the equivalent server in its private project-local
configuration; the ignored `.claude/social-vibecoding-mcp.local.json` is only a
credential-free ownership marker used for safe, idempotent updates. Both
clients load MCP configuration only for a trusted project; do not authenticate
from an unreviewed or unexpectedly modified checkout.

Optional diagnostic commands:

```bash
node ./tools/social-vibecoding auth status
node ./tools/social-vibecoding logout
node ./tools/social-vibecoding auth server list
```

If login ends after an ambiguous network failure, check Settings →
CLI & coding-agent access and revoke any unexpected credential by its hint and
creation time before retrying.

A few things won't work locally:

- **GitHub App actions** (creating branches/PRs for user edits) need a
  real App installed against a real org — no great way to fake it
  for local-dev yet. The import-existing flow specifically needs
  `GITHUB_BOT_TOKEN` set in `.env` to do anything more than return
  the `no_token` error.
- **Let's Encrypt TLS** — Caddy can't issue certs against `localhost`;
  expect self-signed / browser warnings.
- **Wildcard DNS** — child-app subdomains won't resolve against
  localhost; you can add entries to `/etc/hosts` for any specific
  slugs you're testing.

For early platform-internal work (group chat, dev-chat, settings,
notifications, etc.) none of that matters; the stack comes up fine.
