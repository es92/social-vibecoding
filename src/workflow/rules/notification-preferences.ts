/**
 * Per-app notification preferences (#1374).
 *
 * ── What this gates, and why it is not the push-preferences table ───────
 *
 * `mobile-push-preferences.js` answers "may this ping my phone". It runs
 * AFTER a notification exists, so turning a category off there still leaves
 * the bell lit and the drawer row in place.
 *
 * This answers a different question: "do I get this at all, for this app".
 * The requester asked for one switch governing the phone push and the
 * on-platform notification together, and the mechanism makes that nearly
 * free — `mobile_push_deliveries` joins `notifications` by id, so gating at
 * CREATION suppresses both in lockstep and they cannot drift. Filtering push
 * downstream would have meant two things kept in agreement forever.
 *
 * The two layers compose: this decides whether a notification is created at
 * all, and the push preferences then decide whether the one that WAS created
 * reaches a phone. Nothing about the existing table changes.
 *
 * On the objection that suppressing the row is destructive (raised on the
 * issue, and fair): what is suppressed is the ping, not the record. A muted
 * new issue is still on the app's Dev board, a muted proposal is still on
 * the board awaiting votes, a muted vote is still on the proposal. Nothing
 * becomes unreachable; you are simply not interrupted. That is a weaker
 * claim than "nothing is lost", and it is the true one.
 *
 * ── Two axes, three layers ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A stored row is keyed (user, app, category), and `app_id` is NULLABLE:
 *
 *   per-app row  →  account-wide row (app_id IS NULL)  →  defaultEnabled
 *
 * The middle layer is the idea from the issue thread, kept because it comes
 * free with the nullable column and makes the settings roll-up far more
 * useful: "quiet by default, except these two apps" is one row plus two,
 * rather than a row for every app the user will ever open.
 */

/**
 * The app-scoped categories, in the order the dialog renders them.
 *
 * `kinds` is what each category gates. A kind appearing here does NOT have
 * to be push-eligible — these are different vocabularies on purpose (this
 * one is app ACTIVITY, the push one is notification TYPE), which is why the
 * account-wide push answer cannot simply be seeded into these.
 *
 * `adminOnly` categories are hidden from people who are neither an admin nor
 * the app's creator, because the events behind them are only ever sent to
 * those people in the first place. Offering the switch to everybody else
 * would be offering to mute something they were never going to receive.
