// ── The connector's canonical name ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// SERVER_NAME is what this server reports as `serverInfo.name` in the MCP
// initialize response, and it is the CANONICAL spelling of the connector
// everywhere: docs, allow rules, the scaffolded `.claude/settings.json`.
//
// #1218: an account had the connector registered as `Uesrnode`, so its
// tools arrived as `mcp__Uesrnode__whoami`. That string is NOT ours — it
// never appears in this repository. Claude.ai's "Add custom connector"
// dialog takes a Name the human types, and the client builds tool names
// from THAT, not from `serverInfo.name`. So the typo was user-entered, and
// the fix is to recommend the canonical name at connect time (the
// Settings → Connectors copy does) rather than to change anything here.
//
// Why lowercase: a client that derives the name from the server gets
// exactly this string, so a client where the user typed it agrees with a
// client where it did not. Any other spelling makes the two paths
// disagree — which is the whole reason the value below is stated once,
// here, and read by the docs, the scaffold and the Settings copy rather
// than retyped in each.
//
// It matters because a Claude Code permission rule names the server as a
// LITERAL: `mcp__homeroom__get_*` is legal, `mcp__*__get_*` is not. A rule
// aimed at a differently-named connector fails SILENTLY — no error, the
// user just keeps getting prompted. Hence: recommend the name, and tell
// people to read it off their own tool list (see MCP-CONNECTOR.md).
//
// ── Why this says `homeroom` and not `usernode` ────────────────────────
//
// The platform is reached at Homeroom's own domain now, and that is the
// name people are told to type when they add the connector. Leaving the
// server reporting `usernode` would break the agreement above in the one
// way it exists to prevent: the docs would say type one thing while
// `serverInfo.name` reported another, so a client that derives the name
// and a client where a human typed it would disagree by construction.
//
// The rename is NOT retroactive, and cannot be. A connector already added
// as `usernode` keeps that name — the client built its tool names from
// what its user typed, and nothing the server reports changes them — so
// existing rules go on matching. What does move is a client that derives
// the name: on its next reconnect its tools become `mcp__homeroom__…` and
// rules written for the old spelling stop matching, silently, exactly as
// above. That is what keeps both legacy spellings in
// ALLOW_RULE_SERVER_NAMES below: the shipped list has to cover the name a
// user is on today as well as the one they will be on tomorrow.
const SERVER_NAME = 'homeroom';

// ── The build the handshake reports ────────────────────────────────────
//
// SERVER_VERSION is `serverInfo.version` in the initialize response — the
// one field in the handshake whose purpose is to say WHICH server answered.
// As a frozen literal it said nothing: three handshakes spanning a deploy
// boundary all reported `1.0.0`, and establishing which build was actually
// live meant reading a client debug log for the truncated-instructions
// length and matching it against SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS at two commits — a
// trick that only worked because that length happened to change between
// them. A deploy that changes behaviour without changing it leaves no
// signal at all.
//
// It matters because MCP splits what a client learns in two: `instructions`,
// tool names and tool descriptions are fetched ONCE at initialize and cached
// for the life of the connection, while tool results are live. A session's
// cached rules can therefore come from an older build than the code now
// answering its calls, and this is the only field that can tell them apart.
// get_connector_guidance sharpens it further — the operating charter a
// connector agent follows now depends on which build served its handshake.
//
// GIT_SHA is the platform's own build stamp, already plumbed through
// docker-compose.yml and read exactly this way by /api/version,
// services/status and services/node-status. Reusing it keeps ONE answer to
// "what is running" instead of minting a second one that can disagree.
//
// `serverInfo.version` is free-form in MCP, so the commit rides along as
// semver build metadata: the string stays parseable, and a build with no
// deploy behind it still reads honestly instead of claiming to be a release
// (staging previews of the platform are built without GIT_SHA, and compose
// defaults it to `dev` — so `1.0.0+dev` says "not a deployed build" where a
// bare `1.0.0` would have said nothing). whoami returns the same string, so
// a session can read it without going through a client debug log.
//
// TWO THINGS MUST NOT MOVE WITH IT. SERVER_NAME stays fixed, because allow
// rules match it as a LITERAL (see above) and a per-deploy name would break
// every rule the platform ships, silently. And the build id stays OUT of
// SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS, which is budgeted to the byte against a client that
// truncates it (SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS_MAX_CHARS): serverInfo and a tool result
// both sit outside that budget, which is precisely why they are the two
// right places to carry it.
const SERVER_VERSION_BASE = '1.0.0';

// Semver build metadata is [0-9A-Za-z-], and GIT_SHA arrives from the
// environment rather than from this repository, so it is narrowed rather
// than trusted. A value that narrows away to nothing leaves the bare base
// version instead of a dangling `+`.

// ── The spellings the shipped rules cover ──────────────────────────────
//
// A permission rule names its server LITERALLY, so a rule is only ever as
// good as the spelling in it. The canonical name is what this server reports
// and what Settings → Connectors tells the user to type — but the field it is
// typed into is a free-text box in someone else's dialog, and the single most
// likely near-miss is not a typo at all: it is the product name capitalised,
// which is how a person naturally writes it and what several clients suggest
// as a default.
//
// So the shipped rules cover BOTH spellings rather than only the canonical
// one. Twice the rules for a name, which costs nothing — a rule that matches
// no tool is inert — and removes the most common silent failure. Anything
// beyond these still needs the user's own spelling, which is what the setup
// tip, whoami and the Settings panel's rewrite field are all for: this list
// is the spellings worth guessing, not an attempt to guess them all.
//
// ── Why the list carries two names and not one ─────────────────────────
//
// `homeroom` and `Homeroom` are the guess pair for the name people are told
// to type today. `usernode` and `Usernode` are not guesses at all: they are
// the name the connector was called before the rename, so they are what an
// account connected before it is REGISTERED AS, and a rule aimed at the new
// spelling would miss every one of them. Both pairs ship until the old ones
// are gone from the connector list, because the alternative is telling a
// user whose connector works today that their rules stopped matching for a
// reason they cannot see.
//
// Order matters only for what a person reads first: the canonical spelling
// leads, so the block someone copies opens with the name the docs told them
// to use rather than the one being retired.

  SERVER_NAME, 'Homeroom', 'usernode', 'Usernode',

// ── Allow-listed, but NOT reads (#1405) ────────────────────────────────
//
// A separate list on purpose. `READ_ONLY_TOOL_EXCEPTIONS` answers "is this
// tool a read?", and these two are not — they write a row. Folding them in
// would make the naming contract above say something false, and that contract
// is what the `get_*` / `list_*` globs' safety rests on.
//
// What they are instead is SELF-SCOPED: the only thing they touch is the
// caller's own notification feed. They spend nothing, reach no app, are
// invisible to the group, and cannot be aimed at another user — the target is
// the connection's own identity, never input. Every ACTING tool puts something
// in front of other people; these put a line in front of you. Granting them is
// a decision about your own attention, which a scaffolded repo may reasonably
// make on a stranger's machine where "every call this connector can make"
// would not be.
//
// Listed literally rather than as a `notify_*` glob: a glob is a standing
// promise about every future tool that happens to start that way.

// The read-only allow rules Homeroom ships in the app scaffold and
// documents. Two globs plus one literal per covered spelling, and
// deliberately NOT the whole-server `mcp__homeroom__*`.
//
// The reason is the SCAFFOLD, not the tools. These rules are committed into
// every app repo Homeroom creates, and a repo that grants a connector blanket
// approval on a stranger's machine is exactly what the workspace trust dialog
// exists to catch — the dialog lists what is being granted, and "every call
// this connector can make" is not a reviewable thing to hand someone. Reads
// are. A user who wants the acting tools allowed too can say so on their own
// account, in Settings → Connectors or their own `~/.claude/settings.json`;
// that is their call to make about their own machine, not the scaffold's to
// make for them.
//
// They stay durable only while the naming contract below holds. Tests
// enforce it against the registered tool surface.
//
// #1405 adds a SECOND literal, for the same reason `whoami` is one: the two
// awaiting-input tools do not fit the read prefixes, and they are called at the
// boundaries of ordinary turns — a prompt on every call would make them worse
// than not having the feature at all.
//
// They earn the exception on the same ground `whoami` does. Every ACTING tool
// puts something in front of OTHER PEOPLE: a request on a board, a proposal at
// a vote, a build against a credit balance. These put a line in the caller's
// own notification feed and nothing else. They spend nothing, touch no app,
// are invisible to the group, and cannot be aimed at another user — the target
// is the connection's own identity, never input. Granting them is a decision
// about your own attention, which is exactly the kind a scaffolded repo may
// reasonably make on a stranger's machine.

//   * A read-only tool is named `get_*` or `list_*`.

//     advances a proposal — is NEVER named `get_*` or `list_*`.
//
// `whoami` is the single grandfathered exception, which is why it has its
// own literal entry rather than a glob.
//
// Adding a read-only tool: name it `get_`/`list_` and it is allowed by the
// rules already in every scaffolded repo, with no migration. Adding an
// acting tool: give it any other name and add it to ACTING_TOOLS in

// ── What the client silently cuts ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// Claude Code applies a plain `str.slice(0, 2048)` to two fields it receives
// from an MCP server: `InitializeResult.instructions` and EVERY tool
// `description`. The instructions case at least logs ("Server instructions
// truncated from 5181 to 2048 chars"); the description case logs nothing at
// all, and `/mcp` renders the full text, so the only way to see it is to
// count the characters yourself. Upstream: anthropics/claude-code#81268.
//
// Neither budget below is the client's 2048. Both leave deliberate headroom,
// for three reasons: the cap is a client-side constant that has already been
// renamed once (`WoH` → `D$` in 2.1.220) and could change value as easily;
// other clients may pick a smaller one; and a field sitting at 99% of the
// limit fails the moment somebody adds a sentence, which is exactly the
// silent failure this is here to prevent.
//
// Tool RESULTS are not capped by any of this — which is why the full
// operating charter is delivered as one (services/mcp-charter.js), next to
// the 32 KB of platform conventions get_platform_conventions already returns.
//
// tests/mcp-instruction-budget.test.js enforces both, measuring the RESOLVED
// descriptions off a registration recorder rather than the source text, so a
// description assembled from constants is measured as the client sees it.
// 1400 -> 1536, which is the CEILING the headroom invariant permits, not a
// number picked to fit one more sentence.
//
// The budget had been reached: SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS measured 1399 of 1400, so
// the next brief of any length failed the build. That is the guard working
// exactly as designed — it fails LOUDLY — but it meant the field was full,
// and the section that hit it is one that protects an ANSWER rather than a
// diff: an agent reading a stale fork reports findings about a version of the
// app that no longer exists, and nothing inside the checkout can tell it so.
//
// Why 1536 and not more: tests/mcp-instruction-budget.test.js asserts this
// budget keeps at least 512 characters clear of the client's 2048, and 1536
// is where that runs out. That invariant is the whole point of having a
// number below the client's — raising IT to make room would turn the guard
// into a restatement of the bug, which is what its own comment warns against.
// So the budget moves to the edge of what is already allowed and no further.
//
// What this deliberately does NOT buy is room for the next addition. At 1530
// of 1536 the build fails again on anything substantial, and that is correct:
// content sitting close under the budget is not a safety problem, because it
// fails at require time rather than silently. A brief earns its place here or
// it lives in the section's `text`, where nothing is capped.
