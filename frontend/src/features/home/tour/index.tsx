/**
 * `#home-tour` — the five-step welcome tour, which replaced the
 * `#home-welcome` banner (#1561).
 *
 * The banner said the two things the launcher never says, in three lines, and
 * then went away for good. What it could not do is point: "send feedback from
 * the Improve button" names a control, and a new account has no way to tell
 * which of the things in front of it that sentence is about. The tour dims
 * the page, cuts a hole around the thing it is talking about, and puts the
 * sentence next to it.
 *
 * ── Real controls, every step ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Nothing here is a drawing of the product. The Improve arc works because the
 * Improve row is reachable on Home: the app's own menu, behind the Homeroom
 * mark, targeting the platform's own self-hosted row for as long as Home is up
 * (`Home.publishImproveTarget`, #1367). So steps 3 to 5 are one interaction
 * rather than three descriptions (step 1, what a community is, and step 2,
 * My apps, only describe what they point at):
 *
 *   * step 3 spotlights the MARK that opens that menu, asking the viewer to
 *     press it. The click is NOT intercepted: the tour subscribes to
 *     `appContextStore` and advances when `open` goes true, so what opens the
 *     panel is the product's own handler and the tour is only watching. Its
 *     Next opens the menu through `AppContext.open()` — the same path — and
 *     the same watcher advances it, so Next never lands on step 4 with the
 *     menu shut;
 *   * step 4 spotlights `#improve-quick-actions`, the well holding Give
 *     feedback and New change INSIDE the menu the viewer just opened. It is
 *     DESCRIBED, not driven: the cut-out blocks the press the way the dim
 *     around it does, because each of them leaves the tour (a dialog, a new
 *     session) and a spotlight is not an instruction to press.
 *     ./tour-steps.ts carries the whole argument;
 *   * the steps after it shut the menu through `Improve.close()`, the
 *     controller's own close path and never a write into its DOM, then point
 *     at the Messages tab, where Homeroom bot is, and the Me tab, whose
 *     screen holds Settings, where the tour can be replayed.
 *
 * ── The island rules, and how each is kept ────────────────────────────
 *
 * This is a fixed overlay that ships in the shell and starts `hidden`, the
 * same arrangement as `#mobile-install-banner` and the banner it replaces:
 *
 *   * THE FIRST RENDER IS THE PRERENDERED MARKUP. Nothing viewer-dependent
 *     is read during render. `open` is false, `index` is 0 and `confirming`
 *     is false on both sides of hydration, so the built document and the
 *     first client pass emit the same tree: step 1's copy, hidden.
 *   * VISIBILITY RIDES REFS. The root, the cut-out, Next and the
 *     confirmation all carry CONSTANT class strings with `hidden` exactly
 *     where the prerender has it, and the toggles go through `useHiddenClass`
 *     / `useClassToggle` or, for the nodes the geometry pass owns, a
 *     `classList` write inside that pass. See ../../../lib/legacy-dom.ts.
 *   * GEOMETRY IS WRITTEN, NOT RENDERED. The shades, the cut-out and the
 *     card's position are `style` writes through refs, for the reason
 *     features/settings/sections/theme.tsx writes its caret index that way:
 *     the shipped markup carries no `style` attribute, and a measured pixel
 *     is not something to reconcile. It also means a resize, a scroll or the
 *     panel's slide re-measures without a React render.
 *
 * Nothing in `public/js/**` writes into this subtree, so the region is
 * React-owned end to end and may hold state (AGENTS.md).
 *
 * ── Following the target, and jumping to the next one ─────────────────
 *
 * The hole is measured once per animation frame for as long as the overlay
 * is up, and written only when the numbers move. It used to be measured on a
 * 50ms ticker for 600ms after each step change, which covered the kit
 * sheet's entrance spring and nothing after it -- and on a phone the panel
 * keeps moving after it: `Improve.open()` refreshes the sessions list over
 * the network once the sheet is up, a session state tick reloads it while
 * the panel is open, the Chats group appears when its bootstrap answers, and
 * the deploy note comes and goes. Every one of those changes the height of a
 * bottom-anchored, content-sized sheet, and the kit answers by holding the
 * top edge and springing the sheet to its new rest (native.js's watchSize),
 * so every row moves by exactly that much. None of those motions announces
 * itself -- a spring on a transform fires no event and no ResizeObserver --
 * so the only signal that is always right is the next frame.
 *
 * Between steps it JUMPS (#3240). The shades, the ring and the card used to
 * carry a 200ms CSS transition, and the per-frame measure rewrote them every
 * frame the target moved (the page's smooth scroll, the sheet's spring), so
 * each write restarted the ease from wherever it had got to: the box chased
 * the menu for over half a second, the four shades and the ring each ran
 * their own curve and came apart (bright bands, a ring squashed to a pill),
 * and the card said step 3 while the ring was still on step 2. Now nothing
 * here animates. On a step change the card goes transparent and the previous
 * hole stays where it was; the new target is measured every frame until it
 * has held still for SETTLE_FRAMES frames, with no CSS transition still
 * running on it or on anything it sits in (or SETTLE_CAP_MS has passed), and
 * then the hole, the ring and the card are painted in one frame. After that
 * the hole is glued to the target, frame by frame, with nothing to lag. A
 * hole under MIN_HOLE (./spotlight.ts) is a target still arriving, not a
 * target, so it is waited out rather than painted as a blue line.
 *
 * ── Where the card goes while the panel is open ────────────────────────
 *
 * Beside the panel, never on it. On desktop, where the panel is a right-side
 * sheet, the card's right edge sits one gap from the panel's left edge and
 * lines up vertically with the middle of the highlighted row, so the eye
 * travels straight across from the sentence to the control. On a narrow
 * viewport the panel takes the whole width and there is no "beside" left, so
 * the rule relaxes to the weaker one: clear of the ROW, above or below it,
 * rather than clear of the panel. ./spotlight.ts's `placeCardForPanel` is
 * both halves, and the fallback is a call to the ordinary `placeCard`.
 *
 * ── One shape dims; four shades block ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A `box-shadow` spread paints a dim but receives no pointer events, so it
 * cannot block a click, and the menu step needs exactly that split: the
 * cut-out must pass clicks through to the real mark while the dimmed area
 * keeps swallowing them. The four panels around the hole are the blockers,
 * and the hole is then genuinely a hole. They used to be the dim as well,
 * which gave a rounded ring square corners of undimmed page (#3240), so the
 * dim is now the spotlight's own shadow, which follows its `rounded-xl`, and
 * the four panels are transparent. With no hole to cut (a target that is not
 * on screen) the top panel, which then covers the screen, takes the dim.
 *
 * ── z-index ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `z-[9993]`, which is deliberate rather than a round number. The Improve
 * panel is `z-50` on desktop, but on touch the kit ADOPTS it into `.un-sheet`
 * (native.css: backdrop 9990, sheet 9991, popover 9992), and the cut-out has
 * to land on the panel's rows on a phone too. 9993 clears all three and stays
 * under the kit's own feedback pill (9995) and debug affordance (99999).
 *
 * ── When it opens, and when it gets out of the way ─────────────────────
 *
 * Only when somebody asks (#3240). It used to open by itself on the first
 * sign-in that reached Home, straight after "What communities do you want to
 * join?", and the two screens said the same things back to back. Now the
 * first row of Home's Getting started card, "Take the 1-minute tour"
 * (../getting-started.tsx), and Settings' "Replay the tour" are the ways in,
 * and both ask through ./tour-request.ts. That path ignores whether the
 * tour was finished before and waits only for Home to be on screen, which is
 * where every step points. Nothing opens it on the `?shot=`, `?demo=` and
 * `?token=` routes except a press, so the platform's declared checks never
 * meet the overlay, with ONE exception that is asked for by name:
 * `?shot=welcome-tour` (#3567) opens it at step 1 once Home is up, the way
 * `?shot=join-communities` draws the join screen, so a declared check can
 * see the tour's first card. That route writes nothing: no kept step, no
 * "done" here or on the account (`isTourShot`).
 *
 * Once it is up it PAUSES rather than fights. Whenever Home leaves the screen,
 * or any kit surface that is not the Improve panel is presented (a dialog, a
 * sheet, an alert), the overlay hides and the step is kept; it comes back at
 * the same step when the viewer does. A panel step whose panel is no longer
 * open resumes at the Improve step instead, which is the one place in the arc
 * that stands on its own.
 *
 * Finish and Skip record "done" in this browser and on the account
 * (./tour-done.ts), which ticks the card's row. A browser that finished the
 * tour before the account kept the answer copies it there once.
 *
 * ── A reload is not a restart ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Nothing here moves a tour backwards except Back, so a viewer who pressed
 * Next and saw step 1 again had their document replaced under them: the
 * shell reloads itself once its replacement build is cached after a cold
 * boot from the worker cache (App._reloadPrefetchedShellIfSafe), and the
 * boot-time session reconcile reloads when the server disagrees about the
 * session. Both land during the first seconds on Home, which is exactly when
 * the tour is up, and a tour that only remembered "finished" started over at
 * step 1 every time -- the "looping between the first and second step" that
 * was reported. The step now rides sessionStorage (./tour-storage.ts), a
 * reloaded document resumes there (`resumeIndex`, ./tour-steps.ts), and the shell's
 * automatic reload treats a live `#home-tour` the way it treats a draft in a
 * textarea: not now (App._hasUnsavedShellInput).

  // THE PANEL MUST BE SHUT. The step's instruction is "press Improve" and it
  // ends on the panel OPENING, so arriving with it already up is a dead end:
  // there is no edge left to wait for. Whichever way the viewer got here —
  // Back from step 4, or a panel opened through an earlier cut-out — it is
  // shut again through the controller's own close path. That is also the
  // answer to what Back does with a still-open panel: it closes it, so the
  // step always presents the same way.
  //
  // THEN THE APP'S MENU OPENS, because #2718 made the step's target a row of
  // it and a row inside a closed sheet has no box for ./spotlight.ts to find.
  // It WAITS for the panel's teardown rather than racing it: on touch the kit
  // cannot present a surface while it is still dismissing another, which is
  // the ordering lib/sheet-controller.js's dismissForNav exists for and the
  // reason `Improve.close()` is awaited here rather than fired and forgotten.
  // (AppContext.open's own `_closeSiblings` dismisses the panel too, but it
  // does not await it — that is the race, not the fix for it.)
  //
  // THE MENU STEP ARRIVES WITH THE MENU SHUT (#2718 review).
  //
  // `opensSheet` retired with the Improve panel. It existed because the step's
  // target was a ROW INSIDE the menu, which has no box for ./spotlight.ts to
  // find while the menu is closed — so the tour had to present the surface
  // first. The target is the MARK now, which is on screen on every route, so
  // there is nothing to present and the viewer's own press is the whole step.
  //
  // What is left is the other half: arriving here with the menu already up
  // would mean the edge into `open` never fires and the step could not
  // advance. So it shuts it, once, on arrival — which is what the deps say.
