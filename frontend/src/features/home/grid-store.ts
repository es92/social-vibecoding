/**
 * The launcher grid's view model — what `#app-list` is about to hold.
 *
 * ── Why a store rather than props ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `Home.render()` used to build the grid's `innerHTML` and hand it to the
 * element. It now computes THIS — plain data, no markup — and pushes it here;
 * `app-grid.tsx` is the only writer of the DOM below `#app-list`. That split
 * is what makes the grid convertible at all: home.js keeps owning the data
 * (the WS fan-out, the layout fetch, the favourite ordering, the card menus),
 * and React owns the rendering, with nothing writing into the other's half.
 *
 * The store lives in its own module, imports nothing from React, and holds
 * only serialisable values — so tests can drive `Home.render()` in Node and
 * assert on the pushed model without a DOM. That is the same property
 * lib/plain-store.js was written for (see its header) and the reason the
 * placement maths stays in home-layout.js: this file is a shape, not a
 * calculation.
 *
 * ── The initial value IS the pre-conversion markup ────────────────────
 *
 * `ready: false` with no items renders nothing, which is exactly the empty
 * `<div id="app-list">` the hand-written shell shipped and the SSG pass in
 * frontend/scripts/build-shell.mjs prerenders. Anything else here would be a
 * hydration mismatch, and a console error on any route fails proposal checks.
 * Nothing fetches from render — `Home.load()` is still called by app.js's
 * router, exactly as before.
 *
 * ── `dragActive` is not in this store, on purpose ─────────────────────
 *
 * The kit's grid placement physically moves `#app-list`'s children during a
 * lift, which is the one window where React must not reconcile. home.js
 * already had that guard (`Home._dragActive`, set in the kit's `onLift` and
 * cleared in `onSettle`, with `_rerenderPending` flushing afterwards), and it
 * keeps it: `Home.render()` returns early while a drag is live, so no push
 * ever reaches this store mid-gesture. Moving the flag in here would have made
 * it look like React state that a render could depend on, when what it
 * actually guards is the ABSENCE of a render.
