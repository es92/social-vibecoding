// The home screen's launcher grid: loads the viewer's apps, lays them out on
// the (column, row) canvas HomeLayout models, renders the tiles, and owns the
// drag-to-rearrange gesture.
//
// THE UI OVERHAUL narrowed what this canvas holds. Discover, Challenges and
// Create app used to be draggable WIDGETS placed on it alongside the app
// tiles; Discover and Challenges are fixed sections below the grid now (see
// features/home/index.tsx), so every item here is a 1x1 app tile, there is one
// column count instead of two, and the drag applies to app tiles alone.
// Create came back INTO the grid as its trailing tile (the prototype's
// scrHome), but not as an item: its cell is derived per paint, never stored
// or dragged — see the note at the end of render().
//
// Moved verbatim from public/js/home.js into the bundle by #1083 chunk F step 4
// (see features/home/index.tsx). Two things changed and nothing else:
//
//   * the app-card delegation is an import now instead of a `window.AppCard`
//     read (see renderAppPillsHtml / iconTileFor below), and
//   * escapeHtml and formatRelativeTime at the bottom of the file are
//     module-local rather than ambient globals. That has a consequence outside
//     this file, spelled out in the note above them.
//
// The `HomeLayout` and `window.HomePanels` reads throughout stay as they are:
// both are published by sibling modules the island imports BEFORE this one, and
// every read happens at call time, long after the bundle has evaluated.

  // and never less than the two-row contract. The bottom third is what keeps

  // ── Dragging an app IN from Discover (#1763) ───────────────────────
  //
  // The launcher above is free placement, so the gesture a Discover card was
  // missing is the obvious one: long-press it, drag it up onto the grid, drop
  // it in the cell you want. Add and place in one go, where the ⊕ badge can
  // only append the app to whatever cell happens to be free.
  //
  // This is THE SAME kit recognizer the grid itself uses, attached to a rail
  // instead of to #app-list, and every callback below is the grid's own. The
  // geometry (_targetCellFor), the drop plan (_planFor → HomeLayout.place),
  // the displacement preview, the release spring and the edge auto-scroll
  // that brings the grid into view are shared code, not a second
  // implementation of any of it.
  //
  // WHAT IS ACTUALLY NEW is one fact: the item being dragged is not on the
  // canvas yet. It is modelled as `_incoming` and parked in the OVERFLOW
  // region (row === MAX_ROWS) for the span of the gesture, with one
  // deliberate consequence — HomeLayout.place re-homes a displaced occupant
  // into the dragged item's vacated rectangle first, and HomeLayout.fits
  // rejects row >= MAX_ROWS, so that step finds nothing and the occupant
  // takes the first free cell instead. That is the right answer here: a tile
  // arriving from off-canvas has no cells to swap with.
  //
  // THE OVERLAY AND `un-reordering` BELONG TO #app-list, not to the rail. The
  // kit puts its own class on ITS list element, and the CSS that makes the
  // grid's tiles pointer-events:none — the thing that lets _cellFromPoint
  // resolve an occupied cell as a target at all — is scoped to #app-list, so
  // this reaches across and sets it there. Safe for exactly the reason
  // _showGridOverlay is safe at all (see its header): _dragActive holds for
  // the whole gesture, render() and load() both return early while it does,
  // and React therefore cannot reconcile #app-list inside that window.
  //
  // Returns a detach function for the lane's own effect to call, rather than
  // parking a handle on Home: there are TWO rails (Featured and Popular) and
  // a single slot would silently drop one of them.

  // ── The home screen's Improve button (#1367) ───────────────────────
  //
  // "Improve" on home means the PLATFORM: the same panel every app gets,
  // scoped to Homeroom's own self-hosted row. Feedback, its dev
  // sessions, its kanban and feed, its repo — all of it already works on that
  // row, which is why this is a target publish and not a second surface.
  //
  // ── Why this is called from render(), and why that matters ─────────
  //
  // THE UI OVERHAUL shipped this once and #1363 pulled it back out, and that
  // bug is worth naming because it is the whole design constraint here: the old
  // version re-targeted the platform row on the RETURN paths only —
  // navigateHome() after backing out of an app. A cold boot at `/` never
  // published anything, so the button appeared only after you had visited an
  // app and vanished again on refresh, which read as a stale leftover of the
  // app just closed rather than as a feature.
  //
  // render() is the fix because it is the one call every path already funnels
  // through: the cold boot's first paint, the WS app events, a search
  // keystroke, and the return from an app. Publishing the same target
  // repeatedly is free — improveStore.set() is a no-op when nothing changed,
  // and setTarget only re-buckets sessions when the slug actually moves.
  //
  // ── The two gates ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
  //
  // HOME HAS TO BE THE SCREEN ON SHOW. render() also runs while an app is
  // open (a WS event repaints the grid behind the app view), and publishing
  // then would overwrite the open app's own target with the platform's —
  // the header button would silently start describing the wrong thing.
  //
  // THE ROW HAS TO BE VISIBLE TO THIS VIEWER. GET /api/apps hides
  // `self_hosted` rows from non-admins unless SELF_APP_PUBLIC_VOTING is on,
  // and answers 404 rather than 403 for the slug so the row's existence is
  // not disclosed. Reading the target out of the list the viewer was actually
  // served keeps that stance exactly: no row in the payload, no button, and
  // nothing here has to know the flag or the slug. It also means the button
  // appears for everyone the moment public voting is switched on, with no
  // second change.
  // Where the last-published platform target is remembered, so the next cold
  // boot can put the button up before /api/apps answers. See
  // publishImproveTarget's "the gap on a cold boot" note.

    // ['app-view'])` — because the shrinking card of the zoom-out IS that
    // element, and it has to keep showing the app's content until it lands.
    // So for the length of that animation the DOM answers "the app view is on
    // show" about a screen the router left, and this gate rejected the very
    // re-publish navigateHome makes two lines later to swap home's target in
    // the same frame. The later publish out of Home.render() lost the same
    // race — /api/apps usually answers before a ~300ms transition ends — so
    // the target stayed null and the header's standing action vanished for
    // the rest of the visit. Only on a leave that ANIMATES: from the App tab
    // the kit falls back to type 'none', which runs fn + after as one
    // synchronous mutation, which is why this read as a Board-only bug.
    //
    // App._revealedScreen is the router's own answer, set by the same

  // the header's standing action was simply MISSING — for as long as the fetch
  // took, on home and on every other platform screen (they all route through
  // here via _enterScreenChrome). It then popped in, which was the "the
  // Improve button shows up a few seconds late" report: not a stale button, an
  // absent one.
  //
  // So publish the LAST ONE first. The row is the same object visit after
  // visit — it is the platform's own app — so a remembered copy is right far
  // more often than "nothing" is, and the real payload overwrites it a moment
  // later either way (improveStore.set is a no-op when nothing changed, so the
  // common case is invisible). Only while the payload is genuinely not here
  // yet: once `_appsLoaded` is true the list is the truth, including the truth
  // that this viewer is not served the row.
  //
  // It cannot leak the row's existence to someone who may not see it: the
  // cache is written only from a publish of a row this profile was served.
  //
  // ── AND HOME IS NOT THE ONLY DOOR ──────────────────────────────────
  //
  // Only Home loads that list. A first visit that lands on #messages,
  // #workshop, #profile or #settings — a shared link, a notification, a

  // untargeted for the whole visit: "THIS APP", Go to workshop to `#`, About
  // empty. It fixed itself once Home had been visited, and for a viewer not
  // served the row it never did. So when neither the list nor the cache can
  // answer, ../app-context/platform-target.js finds the row on its own — the
  // slug from GET /api/version, then GET /api/apps/<slug> — and calls this
  // publisher again with the answer, so the two gates above still decide.

  //
  // Every row is one app-grid cell EXCEPT one kind: a row with NOTHING in it
  // is half a cell. It is still exactly where the viewer left it and still a
  // cell they can drop into — it just stops reserving a whole tile to be
  // empty, which is what keeps the two fixed sections below the grid from
  // being pushed down by a viewer's deliberate gaps.
  //
  // A second kind used to qualify: a row a FIT widget owned outright sized to
  // what that widget actually drew (#968). Widgets are not on this canvas any
  // more, so that rule went with them — and the two sets were disjoint by
  // construction anyway (a fit row needs content to size to, a blank row has
  // none), so removing one leaves the other exactly as it was.
  //
  // Returns '' for "no template at all", which is the search-view answer:
  // app.css's `grid-auto-rows: var(--home-cell-h)` is then the only row
  // sizing, byte-for-byte as before.
  //
  // ONLY AS MANY ENTRIES AS THERE ARE OCCUPIED ROWS. Declaring all eight
  // would make them EXPLICIT tracks, and an explicit grid exists whether or
  // not anything is in it — a viewer with three apps would get a ~950px
  // canvas of empty rows below their tiles. Today the grid's rows are
  // implicit and stop at the last placed item; that must stay true, which is
  // also why blankRows() only ever names rows INSIDE that bound.
  //
  // `auto`, not `min-content`: #app-list has no definite height (it flows
  // inside .home-body-fill), so an auto track resolves to the item's content
  // height and grows if content is added — and it sidesteps the question of
  // what min-content means for a scroll container, which .home-panel-card is
  // (`overflow-hidden`). The floor is the smallest block the widget ever
  // draws, so it can never ADD space to a real state; its one job is to stop
  // a slot that rendered nothing from taking its row to zero and reading as

  // #931: start warming the app the finger is already on — the token mint
  // and the TCP/TLS handshake to its origin — so the tap that follows can
  // point the iframe at the app in its own tick. `pointerdown` is the real
  // lever on touch (it fires ~100ms before click, and long-press-to-drag
  // still ends up here harmlessly); `mouseenter` buys much more on desktop.
  // Passive: this never calls preventDefault and must not delay scrolling.
  //
  // #1882: the STATUS is not consulted here, on purpose. app-grid.tsx's
  // `wireRef` is guarded by a module-level WeakSet, so this runs exactly once
  // per card DOM node — and React keeps that node across re-renders. Reading
  // `card.dataset.status` here therefore froze a snapshot taken the first
  // time the tile was ever attached: an app that was still coming up when
  // the homepage painted got no listeners, and got none later however many
  // times it reached 'running'. That is the slow case the issue is about, on
  // a cold load, where rows move into 'running' while the viewer watches.
  //
  // `App.prewarmApp` already re-reads the live launcher record and returns
  // unless `rec.status === 'running'` (also `demo`, `self_hosted`, `url`,
  // offline), so the check belongs there — at event time, against the truth —
  // and this only has to attach. That is the shape browse.js's two call sites
  // always had, which is why the homepage was the one surface with this bug.

  //   gen 4: the letter glyph steps down to the faint grey the in-app
  //          letter tiles now use (--text-faint); emoji unchanged.
  //   gen 5: the tile is rendered per colour scheme instead of pinning
  //          the light face — gen 3/4 baked an opaque #ffffff square,
  //          which read as a bright white tile on a dark homescreen.

  // (Flutter repo issue #518), so it is gated on the capability the
  // shell advertises once it honours the field end to end.
  //
  // Absent the flag, everything below stays on the gen-5 path: bake the
  // face matching the current system appearance and re-send on a flip,
  // with the known limitation that the correction waits for the next
  // app open. Present, the payload carries both faces and stops
  // depending on the appearance at all.
  WIDGET_DARK_ICON_CAPABILITY: 'homeScreenShortcutDarkIcon',
  // ── Why this is not a plain `NativeChrome.has()` any more ───────────
  //
  // It was, and that is what kept the released shell fix invisible. The
  // capability list arrives from getBridgeInfo, which resolves
  // `{ version: 0, capabilities: [], degraded: true }` whenever the
  // handshake times out or the privileged channel is refused —
  // circumstances that say NOTHING about what the installed app can
  // store. `has()` collapses that to `false` (it is deliberately binary,
  // see public/js/native-chrome.js), the old code memoised the answer in
  // `_darkIconProbe` for the rest of the page load, and every tile went
  // out as a single face under a `tile:5:<scheme>:…` marker. The next
  // pass agreed with itself, so the grid never recovered — the exact
  // latched-negative shape issue #978 forbids.
  //
  // So the probe is TRI-STATE now, on three levels:
  //   1. `NativeChrome.supports()` — true / false / null, where null is
  //      "could not say" (no bridge, degraded info, empty capability
  //      list). A null is never memoised: `_darkIconProbe` is dropped so
  //      the next heal pass asks the shell again.
  //   2. A behavioural verdict (below), because "does not advertise" and
  //      "cannot store" are different claims and only the second one
  //      matters here.
  //   3. `_widgetDarkIcons` itself stays true / false / null, and the
  //      synchronous payload + marker builders test it with `=== true`,
  //      so an unresolved probe behaves exactly like the old
  //      single-face path rather than emitting a half-built pair.
  //
  // Both entry points still await the probe before building a payload or
  // a marker — a pass that ran on the unresolved value would send a
  // single face that the next pass immediately re-sends as a pair.

  // drop this anywhere" is visible rather than something to discover.
  //
  // The overlay is a real GRID sharing #app-list's own template, gap and row
  // height — that is what guarantees pixel alignment with zero arithmetic,
  // and it doubles as the hit-test surface (_cellFromPoint). The layer is
  // pointer-events:none; the individual cells re-enable them so
  // elementFromPoint lands on a cell rather than on a tile behind it.

  // assumed 116px everywhere would
  // draw its cells off the tiles they sit behind. That is not cosmetic:
  // _rectForCell measures these cells to decide where the release glide
  // lands, so any drift becomes a jump at the end of every drop.
  //
  // getComputedStyle returns the USED sizes of the container's EXPLICIT
  // tracks — "116px 67.5px 116px" — so this is one read from the element
  // that already decided the answer, not a second derivation that could
  // disagree with it. Rows past the template are implicit in the grid and
  // absent from that string; the overlay pads them to MAX_ROWS with the cell
  // token, because the canvas is always eight rows deep even when the content
  // is three. Those padded rows are empty too, and they stay a FULL cell on
  // purpose: being past the template they cost the page nothing, so there is
  // no height to reclaim there and a full-size drop target is worth more.

  // the search view) — leave the overlay's own grid-auto-rows alone, which is

  // that model cannot express a layout with holes. Keeping it as a fallback
  // would have meant two incompatible ideas of what the home screen is,

  // Empty-state ("No apps yet") has two variants — the existing
  // "Create your first app" CTA for users with permission, and a
  // muted "Ask an admin to enable app creation" hint for users
  // without. Toggle the CTA button on/off in place rather than
  // rebuilding the static DOM, so the surrounding "No apps yet"
  // copy stays put.
  // The one wording of "you can't create apps right now". The Create tile
  // is on every home screen regardless of quota, so this string is what the
  // locked tile announces in its tooltip and label. The dialog it opens
  // carries the exact used-of-limit numbers.
  CREATE_DISABLED_HINT: 'View your app allowance or request more slots.',

  // `wireCreateButtons()` lived here: `document.querySelectorAll('.home-create-btn')`,
  // each button cloneNode'd and swapped for a fresh copy so a re-paint could
  // not leave two listeners on it, then a click handler bound to the clone.
  //
  // Its one caller was `HomePanels._wire`, and its one matching element is now
  // rendered by features/home/create-tile.tsx. Both halves of what it did
  // stop applying there: React keeps the element across paints, so there are
  // no stale listeners to clear, and the clone-and-replace is a structural DOM
  // write inside a subtree React owns — the exact failure the ownership rule
  // exists to prevent. Keeping it as an unused helper would leave that loaded
  // gun pointed at the block, so it went with its caller.

  // Targeted deploy-state update for a single app. Called from the
  // `app_redeploy_status` WS handler (deploy END triggers a full
  // Home.load() instead — see app.js) so the home screen flips into
  // the deploying state without a full re-render that would blow away
  // pending hover/scroll state on other cards.
  //
  // The commit pill no longer renders on the card face — build info
  // lives in the "…" menu's header, which is built lazily from the
  // Home._apps cache at open time. So this refreshes the cached app's
  // version/deployProgress, so a menu opened next shows fresh info.
  //
  // It used to ALSO re-class the tile's status dot, which was the only
  // visible "this app is redeploying" signal on an already-running card.
  // That dot is gone from the tile face on purpose (see renderAppCard), so
  // an in-flight redeploy of a running app now changes nothing visible on
  // the tile — it shows in the "…" menu's version pill instead. Nothing
  // else regressed: every non-running status still says so in words, and
  // those come from a full Home.load() as before.

// `const Home` at the top of a classic script lands in the GLOBAL LEXICAL

// bare `Home` resolves fine. home-panels.js guards nine call sites on
// `window.Home && …` (the same defensive shape it uses for `window.App` and
// that app.js satisfies with `window.App = App`), and every one of them was
// silently taking the "Home isn't loaded" branch forever: the Discover
// widget always rendered its empty-state note instead of the curated tiles,
// the Create widget always rendered LOCKED regardless of quota, the discover
// tiles and the create button were never wired, and hiding a widget never
// reloaded the grid. None of it threw — the guards are exactly what made it
// silent. Publishing Home the way App and HomePanels publish themselves is
// what makes those guards mean what they read as.
//
// Still published as a global now that this rides in the React bundle (#1083
// chunk F step 4): app.js's navigateHome / _exitHome / resyncCurrentView and its
// whole WS app-event fan-out, app-view.js, build-log.js, the settings screen's
// widget rows, notifications.js, the work drawer and the app-card helpers all
// reach it by name. The `const Home` note above is now redundant for the reason
// it describes — a module's top-level const was never on `window` either — but
// it records why the publication exists. The guard is for the SSG prerender pass:
// frontend/scripts/build-shell.mjs evaluates the island's whole module graph in
// Node, where there is no window.

// escapeHtml and formatRelativeTime used to be AMBIENT here: as a classic
// script's top-level function declarations they were `window.escapeHtml` /
// `window.formatRelativeTime`, and home.js was the LAST tag to declare either,
// so it won a last-writer-wins chain. Inside a module they are module-local,
// which is the right scope and matches what browse.js, app-card.js, kudos.js and
// leaderboard.js already did when they moved.
//
// formatRelativeTime has no ambient consumer left: browse.js carries its own
// copy and build-log.js's comment says it deliberately kept one local so load
// order wouldn't matter. Nothing else ever read it.
//
// escapeHtml has two, and they change which copy they resolve to. dev-chat.js
// and app-secrets.js call `escapeHtml` (and, in app-secrets, `escapeAttr`, which
// is app-view.js's and calls the ambient escapeHtml) without declaring one, so
// they were reaching THIS function; with home.js out of the classic chain the
// last declaration standing is app-view.js's. The two differ: this one is a
// textContent→innerHTML pass, which escapes `& < >` but NOT quotes (hence the
// `.replace(/"/g, '&quot;')` its own callers above add), while app-view.js's
// replaces all five of `& < > " '`. In element content the rendered text is
// identical — `&quot;` and `&#39;` render as `"` and `'`. In an ATTRIBUTE
// app-view.js's is simply correct where this one could be broken out of, so the
// two dev-screen surfaces get a strictly safer escaper and the same visible
// output. Worth knowing about rather than papering over, which is why it is
