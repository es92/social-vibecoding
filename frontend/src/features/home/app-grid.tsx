/**
 * `#app-list` — the launcher grid, as the only React writer below that node.
 *
 * ── The ownership split this conversion makes ─────────────────────────
 *
 * Before: `Home.render()` built the whole grid as an HTML string, assigned it
 * to `#app-list.innerHTML`, and then re-attached every listener with four
 * `querySelectorAll` sweeps (`Home._wireCards`). Every WS app event and every
 * search keystroke destroyed and rebuilt the subtree.
 *
 * After: `Home.render()` computes the view model in ./grid-store.ts and this
 * component renders it. React reconciles — a status change repaints one tile's
 * label instead of rebuilding forty nodes, and a card element survives across
 * renders, which is what lets the per-card gesture wiring below attach once.
 *
 * home.js keeps everything that is NOT markup: the app list and its WS
 * fan-out, the layout fetch and its persistence, the card menus, the drag
 * geometry (`_targetCellFor` / `_planFor` / `_rectForCell`), and the kit
 * attachment. That is the boundary the migration skill asks for — one owner
 * per subtree — and it is why the gesture code below is CALLED from here
 * rather than reimplemented here: those functions attach listeners to nodes,
 * they do not write markup, so they are not a second writer.
 *
 * ── The markup is like-for-like, and that is load-bearing ─────────────
 *
 * Same classes, same `data-*`, same structure as the string this replaces.
 * Four separate consumers depend on it and none of them would fail loudly:
 *
 *   * the kit's placement recognizer selects
 *     `.app-card[data-yours]:not([data-demo])`;
 *   * `App._tileFor(slug)` (public/js/app.js) finds the zoom-out rect with
 *     `#app-list .app-card[data-slug="…"]`;
 *   * app.css styles `.app-card`, `.app-icon-tile[data-icon]`,
 *     `.app-card-title` and `.app-card-status`;
 *   * dapp.json's declared checks select on these chains.
 *
 * The new widget language reaches these tiles through the token layer
 * (tailwind.config.js) and app.css, not by respelling the classes here — so
 * the reskin and this conversion stay independently reviewable.
 *
 * ── Why the cell is an inline style, written as an ATTRIBUTE ──────────
 *
 * Per-cell placement is `grid-column`/`grid-row` on the item. Those cannot be
 * Tailwind utilities: the values are per-viewer data, and Tailwind's extractor
 * is a regex over source text, so an arbitrary-value class built from a
 * variable would never compile. Inline is also what the string version did.
 *
 * It is written with `setAttribute`, not through React's `style` prop, and
 * that is load-bearing. React sets styles through the CSSOM, one longhand at
 * a time, and `grid-column` + `grid-row` together cover all four longhands of
 * `grid-area` — so the browser re-serializes the declaration block as the
 * SHORTHAND: `style="grid-area: 1 / 2 / span 1 / span 1"`. The text
 * `grid-row` disappears from the attribute, and dapp.json's declared check
 * for placed tiles selects on `.app-card[data-yours="true"][style*="grid-row"]`.
 * Writing the attribute keeps the exact spelling the string version emitted,
 * which is the like-for-like rule applied to a value the CSSOM would
 * otherwise rewrite underneath us. React does not manage `style` on this
 * element (no `style` prop is passed), so there is no writer to race.

 * The launcher's loading state.
 *
 * ── It is in the PRERENDER now, and that is the whole point ───────────
 *
 * These used to wait one effect tick behind a `mounted` flag, so that the
 * first client render matched the empty `<div id="app-list">` the shell
 * prerendered — hydrating anything else is a mismatch, which `console.error`s,
 * which fails proposal checks. The cost was written off as "one frame of the
 * same blank the prerender already shows".
 *
 * It is not one frame. public/sw.js serves that prerendered document to every
 * navigation it can win, and the React bundle does not hydrate until it has
 * parsed and executed — measured at ~2.2s on a 4x-throttled cold load. For all
 * of that time the home screen showed an EMPTY launcher, which does not read
 * as "loading", it reads as "you have no apps".
 *
 * The fix is not to render them earlier on the client but to render them in
 * NODE as well: `renderToStaticMarkup(<Shell/>)` walks this same branch with
 * the same INITIAL store, so the placeholders are baked into the shipped
 * document and the first client render produces the identical tree. Same
 * agreement, one less blank screen — and the `mounted` gate goes with it,
 * because what it was protecting against no longer exists.
 *
 * ── Why eight ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two full rows of the 4-column grid: enough to read as a launcher filling
 * up, short enough that a viewer with three apps does not watch five
 * placeholders evaporate.
